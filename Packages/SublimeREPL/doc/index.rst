SublimeREPL
===========

SublimeREPL is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 that adds a way to run interactive 
interpreters of several languages within a normal editor tab. It also allows 
connecting to a remote interpreter (e.g. Clojure/Lein) though a telnet port. 

SublimeREPL has a built-in support for command history and transferring code from
open buffers to the interpreter for evaluation.
