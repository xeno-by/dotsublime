## Installation

The best way to install Soda Refined is through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

If you do not wish to use Package Control, clone this repository directly into the `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area (`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages` on OS X). The git clone command would be as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/cafarm/soda-refined-theme.git "Theme - Soda Refined"

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* For Sublime Text 2 (Build 2174) and later - Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`. For earlier builds - Open your User Global Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light Refined.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark Refined.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light Refined.sublime-theme"
    }

You will have to restart Sublime for the theme to take full effect.

## Bonus Options

### Syntax Highlighting Color Schemes

Soda Refined includes four of the best color schemes available (two light, two dark). Each color scheme has been refined from its original version to work well with Soda Refined. Color schemes are activated via `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Theme - Soda Refined` in Sublime Text 2.

### Fold [...] Image

Interested in an improved fold [...] image? In the current version of Sublime this image is hard-coded to the `Theme - Default` folder. Once you've installed Soda Refined, overwrite `Packages/Theme - Default/fold.png` with `Packages/Theme - Soda Refined/Soda Light Refined/fold.png`.

## Legals

This theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
