# Soda Refined Theme

This is a fork of Ian Hill's excellent [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme). This fork is an attempt to refine some elements of Ian's original theme to produce the best Sublime Text 2 theme possible.

## Design

Soda Light is the only refined version at the moment.

## Installation

If you are a git user, the best way to install the theme and keep up to date is to clone the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/cafarm/soda-refined-theme.git "Theme - Soda Refined"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Soda Refined`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* For Sublime Text 2 (Build 2174) and later - Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`. For earlier builds - Open your User Global Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light Refined.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light Refined.sublime-theme"
    }

You will have to restart Sublime for the theme to take full effect.

## Bonus Options

### Syntax Highlighting Colour Schemes

The Soda Light Refined screenshots use a modified version of Espresso Soda.

If you'd like to use the syntax highlighting scheme shown in the screenshots: 

* Download [colour-scheme.zip](http://mcafaro.com/soda-refined-theme/colour-scheme.zip)
* Unzip and place the extracted `tmtheme` files in the Sublime Text 2 `Packages/User` folder
* Enable the colour scheme via `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> User`

## Additional Details

For additional details see the original [Soda Theme repository](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).

## Legals

The theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
