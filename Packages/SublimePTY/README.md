## I want to test this? ##

First of all remember this is actually a PRE-ALPHA. It means, SublimePTY at this moment is probably not suitable even for testing. But if you insist: 

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Once installed
	1. **Windows**: Start SublimePTY/console/console_server.py; **Linux/OSX**: pass
	2. **Windows + Linux/OSX**: [Command Palette] -> SublimePTY.

## What platforms are supported? ##

Supported? None ;) 
Development is done separately on Linux/OSX and Windows versions. 
Alpha "works" on Linux and OSX for some time now. 
Recently, Windows verion is in very active development and should be released as beta first (10:12  14 May 2012).

## Documentation? ##

Buahahahahaha... :-)

## Something doesn't work. Fix it! Now! I want this now OMG, I have important stuff to do, work you lazy bastard, work!!111!11oneone!eleven!!? ##

Help with the development: during pre-alpha tell me what programs refuse to start under SublimePTY, once alpha is released send bug reports, test things, maybe try doing development on windows if you're feeling adventurous. 

If you're busy and/or for some other reason unable to contribute, then [you can buy me a beer, or two](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=paypal%40wuub%2enet&lc=US&item_name=SublimePTY&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted).  I noticed that feature requests sent with a beer get much higher priority, it's a mystery I know ;-)
