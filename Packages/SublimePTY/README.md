SublimePTY - PRE-Alpha release

* I want to test this?

First of all remember this is actually a PRE-ALPHA. It means, SublimePTY at this moment is probably not suitable even for testing. But if you insist: 

Use Package-Control and add this repository: http://wuub.net/sublimepty-alpha.json
Once installed use [Command Palette] -> SublimePTY.


* What platforms are supported?

Supported? None ;) Alpha should start on Linux and OSX. 
Windows is out for now.

* Documentation?

Buahahahahaha... :-)

* Something doesn't work. Fix it! Now! I want this now OMG, I have important stuff to do, work you lazy bastard, work!!111!11oneone!eleven!!?

Help with the development: during pre-alpha tell me what programs refuse to start under SublimePTY, once alpha is released send bug reports, test things, maybe try doing development on windows if you're feeling adventurous. 

If you're busy and/or for some other reason unable to contribute, then [you can buy me a beer, or two](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=paypal%40wuub%2enet&lc=US&item_name=SublimePTY&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted).  I noticed that feature requests sent with a beer get much higher priority, it's a mystery I know ;-)
